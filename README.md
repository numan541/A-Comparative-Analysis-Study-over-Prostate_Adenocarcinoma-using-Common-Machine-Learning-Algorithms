# A-Comparative-Analysis-Study-of-Common-Machine-Learning-Algorithms over Prostate Adenocarcinoma dataset
A set of machine learning algorithms were applied over Prostate adenocarcinoma dataset using jupyter notebook as an environment.
Two files have been attached:
PRAD labelled (Contains the information of labels at the end, features on the column and instances on the rows)
A set of ML algorithms were employed using SKlearn library. Comparative analysis over the classification task were evaluated using different evaluation matrics like:
Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall scores etc...
